# Project Vision: NLP-Supported ADHD Assistant

I want to design an advanced NLP-powered assistant to make the lives of people with ADHD more manageable and productive. This assistant will continuously monitor the userâ€™s environment using cameras, microphones, and various sensors while staying connected to a cloud-based NLP/AI system in real time. The primary aim is to enhance quality of life by supporting memory, focus, and time management.

**Main Features:**

**Object and Information Reminder:**
        Users can ask where they placed items, inquire about upcoming appointments, or get reminders for important tasks or information. The assistant will provide prompt responses to help users stay organized.

**Immediate Alerts:**
        The assistant will notify users if they leave a location without essential items such as their jacket, wallet, or cards.

**Time and Task Management:**
        It will track appointments, bill payments, credit card deadlines, and other crucial tasks, sending regular reminders to keep users on track.

**Decision Support for Indecisiveness:**
        When users face indecision, the assistant will suggest the best option based on their past preferences and choices. This will help guide them toward decisions that align with what they have previously enjoyed or found effective.

**Additional Features:**

**Customized Routine Management:**
        The assistant will learn daily routines and suggest optimizations to improve productivity, including time management techniques

**Digital Notepad and Task Tracker:**
        Users can take notes through voice commands, which the assistant will categorize and link to reminders, integrating them with a to-do list for comprehensive task tracking.

**Proactive Reminders:**
        The assistant will learn user habits and send proactive reminders without being prompted, ensuring no important tasks are missed.

**Noise Management:**
        The system will monitor ambient noise levels and suggest using noise-canceling headphones or white noise to help users maintain focus.

**Personal Analysis Reports:**
        Weekly and monthly analysis reports will summarize user habits, strengths, and areas for improvement, with personalized recommendations.

**Emergency Mode for Critical Reminders:**
        The assistant will send urgent alerts for crucial appointments or deadlines, possibly through a vibration device or portable alert system.

**Social Behavior Awareness:** 
        The assistant will observe and analyze common social behaviors throughout the day and provide subtle advice or alerts about noticeable patterns that users might be unaware of, helping them adjust and improve their interactions.

**Technical Approach:**

**Data Security and Privacy:** User data will be protected and processed in accordance with stringent privacy standards within the cloud-based system.

**Customizable Structure:** Features can be tailored to user preferences for a more personalized experience.

**Real-Time Processing:** The assistant will handle user commands and sensor data in real time, ensuring quick and accurate responses.
